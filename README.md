#Droga5 Banner Staging Site Template

1.    Put your banners in the /banners folder.
2.    Edit the manifest.json file with the names of your creatives, and the paths to the files.

Tip: to fire up a staging server without having to launch MAMP, cd into this directory and type
```
$ php -S 0.0.0.0:8080
```
